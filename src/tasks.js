      <h3>Change Link Visibility â€” Event Listener with mouseover and getElementsByClassName</h3>
      I am relatively new to JavaScript.
      I've searched the internet over and found what people are calling solutions and correct scripts and fixes etc., but none of them seem to work for me so I'm clearly missing something. Been troubleshooting for hours now. Please help!
      CSS: I have created a simple two-column div (out of 12, it's floated left). I have a CSS transition in place to pull it from 2% width to 15% width (nearly the full two columns) on hover.
      HTML: I created a few test links in the div which I've hidden with a CSS class.
      JS: I am trying to use JavaScript to make them visible when the mouse is over the div. For what it's worth, I've also tried document.getElementsByClassName(menulinks").style.visibility="visible"; without any luck and I've tried accomplishing the same thing using opacity instead of visibility and that made no difference.
      Thank you.`,
